Which sprint am I working on?
Just getting into sprint 2 after my Aussie holiday.  Finished sprint 1 on first couple days of hols, and chose to be present on the holiday and enjoy a few days off with partner and family.
Started an HTML/CSS for dummies book on the plane back and finished it yesterday, and feel I got a good grounding in how CSS operates.
Now read through and skimmed concept resources and stretch materials, and organised my bookmarks, so onto 

Am I keeping up with the material? If not, why not?
Well, sort-of.  I'm further behind than many, but I'm not concerned and am happy with my start.  I've allowed myself to go slow to fully absorb the foundation concepts as i know it's important.

Am I blocked on anything?
Not really, just personal discipline around time, but that's getting better and better. I'm really enjoying the learning and understanding :-)

What are my stress levels?
Low, both for study and for work.  I've got less than 2 weeks to go of work, and I've handed over most of my work already.

What are my frustrations?
Forgetting things I knew a week or so back, such as some command line and GIT tricks. But I know it's all about using them and practice, and there's plenty of that ahead :-)

Which concepts I found most interesting
Loved learning about CSS... more of that today.  I already know what CSS is, but had only scratched and hacked before on other folks' work. Getting a good understanding of the box model has been very satisfying.

Make progress in other areas (30 mins typing practice/week, 2 mins meditation/day, etc...)
I've been meditating most (but not all) mornings (including on the plane back from the GC), have been for a swim Thursday and this morning, and am walking home from work at least 2 times a week.  I feel all of those are helping me keep in a good space :-)
